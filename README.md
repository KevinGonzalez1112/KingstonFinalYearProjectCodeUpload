Code repository for my final year Computer Science project submitted to Kingston University as part of my undergraduate degree.

Includes an SQL dump of the database aswell as the PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript code used in this proof of concept prototype. 

This project was created following thorough prior analysis on the topic and with the following aim in mind:

'To reduce the amount of time wasted by lost forms and the current inefficient work systems in the Gibraltar department of motor vehicles and transport.'

Overall the project was not as much of a success as would have been liked, with future work still needed on this project if it were to serve any true purpose in a real 
world scenario. However, it still met the requirements of the exercise it was required in and the overall project was still able to come away with an A grade (71%).
